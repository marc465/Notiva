While reviewing junior CVs, it's crucial to identify potential concerns that might
indicate a lack of readiness for the role.
Unclear role goals, a CV that lacks a clear objective or career focus can suggest the
candidate is unsure about the position they're applying for.
Tailored applications demonstrate genuine interest.
Over-emphasis on irrelevant details, including unrelated experience, like summer jobs that
don't demonstrate transferable skills, might dilute the CV's impact.
Encourage candidates to highlight activities related to teamwork or leadership if their
experience is limited.
Lack of self-initiated learning, in tech roles especially, not showcasing self-driven projects,
online courses, or certifications can indicate a lack of enthusiasm for learning outside formal
education.
Poor formatting or errors, spelling mistakes, inconsistent formatting, or vague descriptions
can reflect carelessness, which might carry over to the workplace.
Providing constructive feedback to juniors can help them refine their applications and
increase their chances of succeeding in future opportunities.
