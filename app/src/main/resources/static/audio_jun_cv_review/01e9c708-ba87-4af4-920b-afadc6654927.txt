Reviewing the CVs of junior candidates requires a focus on potential rather than extensive experience.
Here are the key aspects to evaluate.
Relevant education and training, look for coursework, certifications, or boot camps that align with the role.
For instance, a computer science degree or a completion of an online programming course can be good indicators of foundational knowledge.
Projects and hands-on experience, since juniors may lack professional experience, evaluate personal or academic projects.
For example, a portfolio website, a mobile app, or contributions to open-source projects demonstrate initiative and technical ability.
Soft skills and learning potential, pay attention to sections highlighting communication, teamwork, or problem-solving skills.
Juniors who express curiosity and adaptability often grow quickly in their roles.
Formatting and presentation, a clean and well-structured CV reflects attention to detail.
Avoiding typos and using clear language indicates professionalism.
Focus on their potential to learn and contribute, and remember that hiring juniors is an opportunity to mold talent into valuable team members.
